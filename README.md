# Sarvekshan

A stupid little application but built in a week for a noble purpose.

This application is only for the citizen's of India to take self-assessment in English or Hindi language to identify their level of risk of exposure to COVID-19/Novel Coronavirus.

It does not collect, store, or distribute any user private information witout the consent of the end-user. There is not backend of the application.

It uses only open source tools & libraries because there is no money. :)
